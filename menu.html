        In Valorant, players engage in tactical, team-based matches with specific objectives. Here are the fundamental rules of the game: Objective:
        The primary objective in Valorant is for one team to plant the Spike (bomb) at designated sites on the map, while the other team attempts to
        prevent the Spike from being planted or defuses it if it has been planted. Teams: Valorant matches consist of two teams, each composed of five
        players. One team plays as attackers, while the other team plays as defenders. Teams switch sides after 12 rounds, with attackers becoming
        defenders and vice versa. Rounds: Each match consists of multiple rounds. A round ends when one team successfully eliminates all members of
        the opposing team, plants the Spike and it explodes, or defuses the Spike. The first team to win 13 rounds wins the match. Economy: Players
        start each round with a set amount of credits, which they can use to purchase weapons, shields, and abilities. Performing well in previous
        rounds or completing objectives earns players additional credits, allowing them to buy better equipment. Abilities: Each player selects an
        Agent, who has unique abilities. These abilities include a signature ability (available every round for free), two purchasable abilities, and
        an ultimate ability. Effective use of abilities is crucial for gaining win.

        Certainly, here are some additional details about Valorant: Development: Valorant is developed by Riot Games, the same company behind the
        hugely popular MOBA game League of Legends. It was announced with the codename "Project A" in October 2019 and officially revealed as
        "Valorant" in March 2020.
